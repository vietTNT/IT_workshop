Hau: Hey sweetheart, how was your school day? 
Phu: Hi daddy, it’s good! We learned about the days of the week and months of the year in class.
Hau: That’s great! So, do you remember the days of the week my baby?
Phu: Yeh! There’s Sunday, Monday Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday.
Hau: Well, excellent! And how about the months of the year?
Phu: Uh - uhm. There’s January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November and December. 
Hau: Wow, wonderful!. You’ve got them all down. That’s my boy. Haha. Well, what’s your birthday, my honey?
Phu: I think it’s July. My auntie’s birthday is also in July.
Hau: That’s right! And the date is 18th, July 18th. Remember that date so you can ask your mommy a doll for your birthday in the later year.
Phu: Oke my daddy.
Hau: What something else, how about your friend? You said you have a crush on a girl in your class, is that right? What’s her name?
Phu: She’s Nhi, daddy. Lemme tell you, she’s a elegant girl with a blonde hair, she’s really good at Literature, and and so kind, daddy.
Hau: Sounds great Phu! Well, you know, you’re a sympathetic, warm-heart boy. I think she belongs with you, my baby.
Phu: Really dad? I want to marry her. She’s the reason behind my smiles.
